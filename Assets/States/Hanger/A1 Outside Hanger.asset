  storyText: 'Festers. Everywhere. Armed mostly with gas-powered rock flingers.

    

    At
    least 10 of them guarding the hangar door. Typical.

    

    Could try punching
    your way through. Or sneaking the long way to the emergency exit.

    

    What
    should you do?

    

    1. Take them head on - rush the 10 guards.

    2.
    Sneak your way to the emergency exit.'
